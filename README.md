## 📚 Learning
This is my [annual study plan](https://github.com/allanfoppa/the-learning-journey), organized into flexible learning phases to help structure my learning goals throughout the year.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a flexible plan, and I will adjust it as needed based on my progress and changing interests.
